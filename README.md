# Financial Optimization with Linear Programming (Python & Gurobi)

This project applies Linear Programming (LP) optimization techniques to solve complex problems in financial planning and portfolio management, developed as part of the M.Sc. in Quantitative Banking and Finance.

## Project Objectives

The repository includes models for:

1.  **Financial Planning (Cash Flow Management):** Maximizing a company's wealth at the end of a 2-year (8-quarter) horizon. The model optimizes borrowing decisions (2-year, 6-month, and quarterly loans) and the investment of surplus funds to meet cash flow requirements in each quarter.
2.  **Bond Portfolio Management (Manager):** Maximizing the return of a bond portfolio, subject to constraints on average credit rating (risk) and portfolio maturity.
3.  **Liability Immunization (Pension Fund):** Minimizing the cost of a bond portfolio structured to fund a pension fund's liabilities over the next 9 years.

## Methodology & Tools

* **Language:** Python
* **Optimization Solver:** `gurobipy` (Gurobi)
* **Data Analysis:** `pandas`

## Key Analyses Performed

In addition to optimization, a full **Sensitivity Analysis** (post-optimality) was conducted:

* **Shadow Prices:** Interpreted to understand how the final objective (wealth) would be impacted by relaxing certain constraints (e.g., a reduced capital requirement in a given quarter).
* **Reduced Costs:** Analyzed to determine how much the price of an out-of-portfolio bond would need to change to be included in the optimal solution.
